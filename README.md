## Setup
Ensure google drive has enough space (at least 12 GBs);
It is recommended to make a new account to have a fresh drive

Mount the Drive to the environment (using the icon in the colab explorer sidebar)

To install necessary resources, run the imports section, it will import automatically

For the first time running the program, run the first section (Import the Dataset).  This section only needs to be run once, as it loads the images into the google drive for training.

## Running

Then, run the convert dataset to npy for whatever data you would like to train on.

After this is done, the train.ipynb file can be run to acquire results

Note: the Convert the Dataset section in get_data and the Build the Model section in train are meant to be adjusted to optimize the model.
